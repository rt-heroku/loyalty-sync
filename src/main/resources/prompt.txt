You are a product manager, designer and brand strategist.  
I want you to generate or mock a brand <brand> in the segment <segment>, or expand on the existing brand I provide.  
<url>

Please create ** <numOfProds> products** that belong to this brand.  
For each product, always include the following fields:

- Product Name  
- Product Type (e.g., jacket, sofa, carry-on, etc.)  
- sku
- Pricing.price
- Brand
- Collection (group if relevant, like “Fall Essentials” or 'Voyageur Travel')  
- Short Description (summary of description under 255 chars)
- Description  
- Key Features (bullet list)  
- Materials  
- Colors (hex codes or names)  
- Dimensions (inches or cm, as appropriate)  
- Weight  
- Warranty Information  
- Care Instructions  
- Images (provide at least 1 mock image URL or suggestion, e.g., Unsplash/Pexels keyword)  

Format the output as a JSON array with <numOfProds> objects, one per product.  

Important:  
- Ensure products feel cohesive as part of the same brand.  
- Mix product types where relevant (don’t make all  <numOfProds> the same thing).  
- Keep descriptions realistic, not overly exaggerated.  
- Make sure the following fields are always included:
	 Pricing.price, SKU, brand, category, product_name, 
	 product_type, collection, description, short_description.
- Do not skip any fields on the example bellow

Very important:
Do not return any other text that is not in the json, specially do not add any comments before or after the json
No text like I'll create a brand called "xyz" in the "xyz" segment. 
And never but never, "Here's a JSON array with two products:"
ONLY THE JSON!!!

Return it in the format of the following example:
